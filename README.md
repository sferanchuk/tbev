# tbev_compare

Algorithms and utilities to support a comparative study of proteins for substrains of tick-borne encephalitis virus.

## List of folders

md - scripts for molecular dynamics simulations

comppdb - software for a comparison of MD trajectories

pkfs - pieces of C++ code for protein modeling

drawalign - several utilities to represent alignments/sequences and per-position distributions generated by a comparison of MD trajectories

alignmut - utilities to represent alignments and statistics of per-position substitutions

vtkview - ulitilty to draw protein structure together with a distribution of NMA vector, implemented within VTK 3D graphics environment 

bubbleview - utility to represent a comparative distribution of NMA vectors, implemented with the use of d3.js functionality
